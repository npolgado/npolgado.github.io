            <h3>Why are you reading this?</h3>
            <p>This is my website, and I thought I'd put a blog post section as a throwback to the beggining of the
                internet, when every site was a blog. I'll probably write here very infrequently, however I tend to
                have some interesting thoughts here and there. At the moment, I'm about 6 months into my first full time
                job as an electrical engineer at Cyngn. Cyngn is a software development company focused on creating
                retrofits for industrial vehicles that will enable autonomy, and the ability to increase warehouse and
                industrial efficiency by a significant factor. I was, and still am very excited to be a part of this
                company, as we are in the forefront of automomy, and are specializing in enviorments which are desperate
                for autonomy, and have a solid stack that can enable these capabilties in more controlled locations.

            <h3>Time</h3>
            <p>Time has been on my mind for... quite a long time. There aren't enough hours in the day, or enough energy
                in my to get everything I want to get done. What is the best way to do the most amount of things in the
                least of amount of time? I want to organize a lot of my ideas in order to fully understand which are
                most important, and which I should prioritize to maximize my use of time.
            </p>

            <h3>Current Projects</h3>
            <p>I have a few projects i've been working on recently that need some higher order thinking... </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An embedded IoT Home Automation ecosystem with Rasberry Pi, Arduino, Flask, and many other
                    integrations</li>
                <li>An app / HW pair that can track dogs while they are walking, detect a (stop + sniff) or (stop + pee)
                    to track the social sniffing / marking that dogs conduct for a dog social media app</li>
                <li>Analog home security cameras to digital format for easy monitoring</li>
                <li>Custom CAN BUS TRACKER for car's, looking into where to tap into can lines on every car</li>
                <li>GPT3 Transcript Summarization and Minutes Presenting Application</li>
                <li>newton's roots set visualization given a polynomial, with adjustable roots</li>
            </ul>
            <p>more thoughts on their significance later...</p>
