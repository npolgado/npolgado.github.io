            <h3>What is a smart home?</h3>
            <p>The term smart home is ubiquitous with an IoT embedded ecosystem where devices talk to each other and
                exhange infomation about its enviorment. I've been working on a home automation system myself, and
                rather than use the many free home assistance platforms, I wanted to make one myself. </p>

            <h3>The core of an Smart Home</h3>
            <h4>At the core of a Smart home ecosystem is 3 main things. </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A Controller: The user or admin which views all information, and can control all aspects of the
                    "smart home"</li>
                <li>A Network Hub: The central processing system between the nodes and the clients of the network. NOTE:
                    in some Smart homes there is no hub, and the typology is closer to an Ad-Hoc network</li>
                <li>Edge Nodes: the many embedded systems that transmit infomation or wait for information to perform
                    their task</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The goal was not just to automate the many different areas in my home, but to also provide a little more
                security, and insight into the activity in my room. With an IoT system there is the possibility for
                voice or event based automation. This gave me the idea to aim for a large final product. My goal is to
                create a suggestion system on top of my event based smart home system, which would suggest automations
                based on my behavior and patterns. This would be great in the case of automations that I had not thought
                of, or even possibly new features to add to the system </p>
            <br>
            <p>I choose to use a python Flask server as my central hub website. This will allow any user on the home
                network to access controls of my home automations. I created a simple dashboard website with different
                pages for everything I'm planning on implementing. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Roadblocks</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest issues right now is the wireless communication. Without it I can't test database
                inquiries or updates based on node processing systems. The goal is to have the nodes send frequenct
                polls with its sensor data, and log that in a database for further analytics. I've gone between a number
                of forms of wireless communcations, including the ESP8266-ESP01, the NRF24LO1+, and a 433 MHz wireless
                communications module. There are pros and cons with each but the big issue is the cross arduino / raspi
                talk. I'm planning on getting arduino uno's with wifi shields, or wifi enables ESP microcontroller
                modules. Either one will allow for each two way wifi communicaitons</p>
            <br>
            <p>My main goal was to really just make it easier to wake up in the morning. I give myself no time, and if
                things like lights turning on, shower turning on, coffee being made, or just a simple calendar view of
                today along with some content, and news. I'd love to see it suggest turning on the lights and computer
                when im close to home. Or reminding me to exercise if I haven't that day.</p>
